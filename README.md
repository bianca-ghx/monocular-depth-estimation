# Monocular Depth Estimation 

This project was developed to estimate the depth of a scene from a single image using computer vision techniques. The input data consists of images, and the purpose of this project is to implement and evaluate monocular depth estimation models.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bianca-ghx/monocular-depth-estimation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd monocular-depth-estimation
    ```
3. Install the required libraries.

## Usage
To use the monocular depth estimation system, follow these instructions:

1. Prepare your dataset by placing the images in the appropriate directories.
2. Run the depth estimation and evaluation using the provided Jupyter notebooks:
    - `cv2-image-depth-estimation.ipynb` for depth estimation.
    - `cv2-image-depth-estimation-evaluation.ipynb` for model evaluation.

## Acknowledgements
This project was developed for the Computer Vision 2 course at POLITEHNICA Bucharest National University of Science and Technology to explore monocular depth estimation in the context of computer vision. The implementation was inspired by the article [“High Quality Monocular Depth Estimation via Transfer Learning”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11941).
